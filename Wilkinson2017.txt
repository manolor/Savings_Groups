Food security remains a challenge in Burkina Faso due to climate-related hazards that have led to decreasing food availability in areas already plagued with low food consumption and malnutrition. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of food insecurity among women in savings groups in northern and central west Burkina Faso and to identify associated factors. Interviews were conducted with 429 women. Logistic regression models were constructed to describe potential associations between key variables of interest and food security. Various factors influenced food insecurity status including income resilience, women’s influences on finances and agricultural activities, the use of multiple agricultural techniques, and dietary diversity. In Burkina Faso, women’s roles are evolving to take on greater responsibility over food security. Knowledge of evolving cultural roles combined with study findings may aid national officials and non-government organizations in the development of programs that aim to improve food security and associated health outcomes.
