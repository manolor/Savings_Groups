The Mutual insurance companies of Solidarity contribute enormously to the financial inclusion of the low-income people, and constitute an answer to the problem of financing of the agricultural activities in rural areas in RD Congo, more exactly in the territory of Mahagi. However, although the agriculture shows financial needs which the informal microfinance is incapable to satisfy, in particular the investments in heavy agricultural equipments which require consequent loans, the Mutual insurance companies of solidarity are an answer adapted in the context of absence of financing in favour of the countrymen and the urban poor people, especially that the institutions of microfinance are in their majority installed in urban areas, and do not take care of farmers, because of the risk which present the actors in this sector. The actors of the informal microfinance (MUSO) develop tools, approaches and innovative networks, which return this socially responsible microfinance.
