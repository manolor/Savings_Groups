Lack of women’s empowerment is a reality for women in Zimbabwe, including rural Shamva women. This research presents findings from primary data collected using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The research departs from other studies by adopting an empowerment perspective to ISALS scholarship. Using the Sara Longwe Women Empowerment Framework, we explore the impact of ISALS on women’s socio-economic status. ISALS were found to contribute to improved financial wellbeing. As women’s economic fortunes improve, they gain respect and regard in the community. Despite these positive indicators, however, ISALS also was found to be a source of exclusion and polarisation.
