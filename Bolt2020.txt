Big data, despite the inherent challenges it poses, has become more and more influential in recent years due to the ever-growing prominence of digital data as well as the constantly improving data management technologies. It has become a powerful tool for analysis in a wide range of industries and fields, even including applications to international development. However, the ability to gain insight from big data is dependent upon good data visualization. Similarly, the savings group model, an implementation of microfinance in developing countries, has risen in popularity in recent decades. This model has been successful by emphasizing local empowerment, but further advancement in the field is limited by the difficulty of data collection. In this study, it is argued that the application of big data analysis to savings group data could provide the needed support for the continuous improvement of the savings group model. Also, the DreamSave mobile application for savings groups, created by DreamStart Labs, provides a platform from which to begin synthesizing these fields. This research includes a theoretical examination of the aforementioned concepts, as well as a practical data visualization project using data from the DreamSave app. Finally, the study documents the challenges and lessons involved in the realization of the practical project, highlighting how they reflect common issues faced in the data-driven software development industry.
