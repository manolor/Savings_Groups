India is considered to be the oldest civilized country in the world, and the status of Indian women has generally remained secondary in the history of Indian culture. In the pre-independence period, women's issues were also very serious. But later on, the social reformers made the women's liberation movement an attempt to get the woman out of the traditional danger. Although in recent times the law has equated women with men, in reality the status quo is quite different. Although these women who have the circumstances often have the power to solve their own questions, they have to rely on others for lack of confidence or opportunity; it is equally true that women have no idea of their own abilities. So they fall prey to social norms, it is a fact. That is why they are constantly being treated as secondary in society and in the family. But now the government has taken an important step in terms of women empowerment by implementing a first, second & third women policy in 1994, 2001 and 2014. The policy covers several important aspects of women's empowerment, with priority being given to the savings group. As a result, women now have the opportunity to prove themselves and their platform. In India, various banks, small financial institutions, micro finance companies have been working with the central government, the state government, at various levels to promote and promote the women's self-help group. Therefore, there is potential for women to get employment opportunities. In a house that is so familiar with chool and child, women are now waiting for the men to shoulder their shoulders. Not only in the city but also women in the rural areas are doing various types of business through their livelihood. The Self Help Group has been a powerful step in the upliftment of women in India. As a result, the Self Help Group, an effective movement in the fight against poverty alleviation, is becoming very popular for the empowerment of women in rural and urban areas.
