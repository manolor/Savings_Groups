Despite microfinance is spread worldwide as a tool to assist the poor, it fail to create inclusion for the poorest of the poor. In Haiti, community-based microcredit associations have been created locally to help fill this gap. As any financial organization, these Associations de Base de Cotisations et de PrÃªts (ABCP) designed internal institutions to govern members interactions and access to credit. In this empirical study, we analyze those institutional arrangements and answer the following question (with econometric estimates): What is the correlation between institutions and access to credit in alternative finance represented by the ABCP? Our results show positive and significant correlation between institutions designed in the ABCP and members access to credit. This result is consistent with previous research on links between social, financial and institutional capital, and create avenue for future research on microeconomic aspects of institutions.
