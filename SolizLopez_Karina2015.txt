People in rural communities depend heavily on local natural resources in order to meet their basic needs, develop productive activities for self consumption and income generation. Sometimes these resources are threatened due to the prevailing economic model which puts at risk the livelihoods of peasant families. The objective of this research is to analyze the role of the social capital of two community groups in the state of Puebla about conservation of natural resources and the importance of these resources in the survival strategies of the group participants. For data collecting, a census was used applying techniques such as direct observation and unstructured interviews. Data were analyzed by t test and analysis of variance. Survival strategies that stand out in the groups are related to farming as fruit growing (highlighting avocado), floriculture, corn and amaranth production, as well as the vegetable and medicinal backyard garden. Related to livestock breeding and fattening families include goats, pigs and dual purpose poultry; interviewed persons also highlighted pottery griddles and pots manufacture. It was found that there are high levels of trust, participation and reciprocity within the groups and within the family, and that women and people over fifty years show greater ignorance about current state in which natural resources are, and the opposite is observed for artisans, people with higher education, and farmers. It is required to address social capital of groups to major impact projects on natural resources conservation, which are important for survival strategies carried out by the members in each group.
