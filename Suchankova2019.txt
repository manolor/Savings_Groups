The provision of formal financial services has expanded rapidly in developing countries over the past two decades. Yet, millions of people remain without access. Savings groups are widely recognized as a powerful tool for delivering financial services to the rural poor where formal financial services are non-existent. This thesis examines savings groups promoted by local NGO CREDI in Benin. The aim is to describe characteristics of savings groups and their members and to assess the life quality improvements that the members reported. The research conducted in Abomey-Calavi Municipality, Benin, consists of 151 respondents from 4 villages, representing 8 savings groups. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using survey questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The findings indicate that savings groups may have a positive impact on the number and volume of membersâ€™ income generating activities and on the resilience against shocks. The findings also revealed that women who are members of savings groups feel more self-confident than before, they have developed a solidarity network and friendship, and they reported that their marital relationships have improved.
