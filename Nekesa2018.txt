This study`s main objective was to investigate the effects of financial innovation on financial performance of deposit-taking SACCOs in Kajiado County. Past studies give an insight into what has already been done in the field of financial innovation and how it impacts financial performance. The researcher pinpoints the strength and weaknesses in the reviewed literature. The resultant information, however, guided this study in addressing the identified gaps in scholarship. The study adopted a descriptive research design. Forty employees of the deposit-taking SACCOs in Kajiado County formed the research sample. Stratified sampling was used to obtain a sample of respondents from whom data was collected. Primary data was collected and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques and then presented using graphs and tables. A self-administered questionnaire was delivered to the respondents and collected after completion. Secondary data was obtained from annual reports, libraries and the SACCO databases. Data was analyzed by use of SPSS. It was established that product, process and organizational innovations are the critical factors that influence the performance of the financial status of deposit-taking SACCOs in Kajiado County. The study recommends that SACCOs require qualified and experienced employees who are capable of meeting new challenges of competition particularly from banks and the government should enact legislations which will protect membersâ€™ savings and promote prudential supervision of the industry.
