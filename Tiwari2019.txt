Financial products and services empower women to grow businesses, survive shocks, accumulate wealth, and take more control over their finances. The BOMA Project supports ultra-poor women in northern Kenya through business and savings groups and a digital financial product. Participants substantially increased income and savings, leading to increased household decision-making power, and education and nutrition expenditure. However, BOMA also observed that illiteracy, innumeracy, and unfamiliarity with technology were barriers to full uptake of the digital product. BOMAâ€™s experience highlights the need for simpler tools designed thoughtfully for the target population, and time for participants to learn to use them.
