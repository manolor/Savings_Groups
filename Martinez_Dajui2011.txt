In this article, we analyze the effect that external financial and technical supports have on the promotion and consolidation of a scheme for community savings and credit associations with peasant groups. Some authors point out the need for these supports to encourage this type of schemes; however, there is no evidence to sustain this. Results from this study show that external supports granted as seed money and technical assistance favor the promotion of savings and credit schemes, but not the consolidation of these schemes because of the projectsâ€™ temporality, allotment mechanisms, interference of other types or supports, and the particular characteristics of each group. Only in certain situations do external supports allow consolidating successful savings and credit schemes with peasants that are self-managing; this is explained by the dynamic present in peasant households, whose basic objective is survival and community savings and credit is only one of the factors that helps them attain their objective.
