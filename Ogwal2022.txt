The study examined various perspectives on Voluntary Savings and Loans Association (VSLA) activities and household food security in Uganda. Specifically, the study examined the effect of VSLA on household food Availability, established the contribution of VSLA on household food Access, and determined the effects of VSLA on household food Stability. The study adopted a literature review approach to collect information. The results suggest a positive relationship between VSLA activities and household food security in Uganda. It further reveals that VSLA activities affect food availability, food accessibility and food stability. It is concluded that if the government of Uganda can improve on the quality of VSLA activities, the level of household food security will improve. This study contributes to the understanding of the association between VSLA activities and household food security in the country. Therefore, for improved household food security, it is encouraged that the leadership of Local Governments focus more attention on mobilising local communities to join VSLA groups so that they can access affordable capital to increase their level of production, which can translate into sustainable household food security in the long run.
