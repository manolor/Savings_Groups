A shift towards integrating the socio-economic needs of local people with the protection of biodiversity has prompted increased awareness that microfinance can be a valuable component within conservation programmes. Access to capital through microfinance programmes has been found to diversify income-generating activities, alleviate poverty and improve livelihoods of the rural poor, thus enabling reduced reliance on natural resources and the promotion of environmental protection. Despite this promising strategy, there has been extremely limited empirical research into conservation impacts, and evidence on this aspect remains scarce and largely anecdotal. Using Conservation Community Banks (COCOBAs) established by Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) in Zambia and Tanzania, this project aims to improve the effectiveness of community-based microfinance programmes for conservation outcomes. It found that participants in such programmes are associated with greater wealth and more positive wellbeing changes and conservation attitudes, as well as perceived pro-conservation behaviour changes. A framework outlining key success-factors across different life-stages of COCOBAs was compiled from the findings which can be used as the basis for future interventions by FZS and for others in similar contexts worldwide. This study found that COCOBAs can contribute to positive development and conservation outcomes in the North Luangwa ecosystem in Zambia and that they represent a potentially valuable tool for conservationists to effectively achieve their objectives
