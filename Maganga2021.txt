The purpose of this study was to explore and discuss the impact of village savings and loan associations (VSLAs) on socio-economic changes among women and resilience against vulnerability. The study employed a descriptive research design, and household-survey methods were used to obtain data from two districts: Chiradzulu Tradition Authority Maoni and Blantyre Rural Traditional Authority Kapeni. The multi-stage sampling method was used to select the samples. The sample size was 70 (n = 70) women from VSLA groups, and the data obtained were analysed using ‘Statistical Package for the Social Sciences’ (SPSS). The findings of the study show the positive contributions of VSLAs towards women, such as an increase in the economic and social level of members. Despite these positive results, it was found that VSLA members have no access to loans from external organisations or banks, and there is also a lack of training among the VSLA members.
