Weexamine the characteristics of women who chose tojoin a women' savings or credit group organized by Save the Children USAin a rural area of Bangladesh, and the impact ofparticipation on contraceptive use. The data are takenfrom a panel survey conducted in 1993, shortly before the groups wereformed, and in 1995 after interventions began. Ourfindings show that although demographic and socioeconomic characteristics have only a weak relationship to the decision to join a program, the treatment that a woman receivesfrom her husband is associated withparticipation. We also find evidence that the credit program tends to attract women who are already using contraception. The analysis of program impacton the use of moderncontraceptives reveals a positive effect of the creditprogram, after we adjustfor this selectivity; we see no evidence of an effect ofparticipation in a savings group.
