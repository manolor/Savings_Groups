By evaluating an ongoing Aga Khan Foundation implemented programme in Kijiji Village, Southern Tanzania, this study explored whether Community Based Savings Groups as informal microfinance delivery systems address poverty, exclusion and inequality within communities and especially among women participants and their households. This was a qualitative study utilising African feminism theoretical frameworks and qualitative interpretative analytical lens. It combined naturalistic ethnography with personal interviews while employing purposive site and participant selection systems. Its unit of analysis was the household rather than an individual. For that matter, three households were observed and interviewed within their Village and homesteads. This included a total of 11 personal in-depth interviews, 2 focus group discussions, a transect walk of Kijiji Village to establish the village’s soci-cultural and economic facilities and a journal as a result of observation and reflection.
The results indicate that CBSGs reach all the four economic categories including the poorest noted in Kijiji village and that through aggregation of savings and enhanced resilience, CBSGs play a catalytic role in poverty alleviation, social and economic inclusion and gender equality in households. Stress and compromised nutrition for children emerge as trade-offs as communities seek moneys to save and repay loans while focusing on accumulation of visible assets. Likewise, inadequate government social services and poor household relations are risks to CBSG’s social and economic effects. This dissertation concludes that the timing of evaluation and use of social constructionist theoretical frameworks are significant in detecting gender outcomes and men’s participation and, in establishing that CBSGs are social networks for women and men alike. Consequently, it points at the need for tailored, longterm and context specific microfinance projects that are inclusive of men and women.
