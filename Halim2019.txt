In Tanzania, women suffer high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV). We conducted a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of IPV prevention interventions targeting men and communities in nine villages randomly assigned to one of three study arms (n = 450 couples). In the Control Group, women participated in savings groups while male partners received no intervention. In Intervention Group 1, women participated in savings groups and men participated in peer-groups addressing gender relations and IPV prevention. In Intervention Group 2, women participated in savings groups, men participated in peer-groups, and community leaders facilitated dialogues on similar topics. Recruitment was completed within one month with 95% retained in the intervention and 81% retained in the endline survey. Acceptability was high, with men participating in 82% of peer-group session hours. More men in Interventions 1 (24%) and 2 (19%) disagreed with wife-beating compared to men in the Control (13%); and more men reported non-perpetration of IPV in Interventions 1 (16%) and 2 (14%) compared to the Control (-2%). Findings suggest a fully powered RCT may detect significant reductions in men's justification and use of IPV, paving the way for evidence-based violence prevention programming
