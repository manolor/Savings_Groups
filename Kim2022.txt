This article reports on a post-test only cluster randomized controlled trial that assessed the impact of exposure to the Child-Optimized Financial Education (COFE) curriculum, delivered within Savings and Lending Communities (SILC) in Uganda, on caregivers’ spending on school and healthcare expenses for children, and caregivers’ financial self-efficacy. Participation in SILCs with COFE was significantly associated with caregivers paying for children’s required school expenses compared to SILCs who were not exposed to COFE. Other outcomes were not significantly influenced by COFE. Child-centered household-level financial planning and saving may support the educational needs of Ugandan children and potentially Uganda’s national-level education targets.
