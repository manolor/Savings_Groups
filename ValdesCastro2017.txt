Based on the evidence found in the accounting books and in the results of the surveys applied to the founding members participating in the GAPC microfinance scheme under study. The results indicate that the form of savings and loan management in the Community Savings and Loan Groups of the COLPOS Córdoba methodology, works in a different way from conventional microfinance systems and that it is possible to establish a single model of operation since the Diversity of situations in the rural sector favors the purpose of implementing this scheme, which is to provide microfinance services to people in rural areas, to  instill the habit of saving and to provide training that will help them to have selfemployment alternatives.
