We estimate the spatial spillover effects of a program to promote savings groups in Uganda and Malawi. We use geolocation data from a cluster-randomized experiment to compare the outcomes of households in areas where a high proportion of nearby villages were randomly assigned to treatment to those in areas where a low proportion of nearby villages were assigned to treatment. We have four key results. First, take-up of the program is highest in villages where promotion by NGO-employed field officers was concentrated -- promotion by peers was about half as effective, and 'organic' replication was rare. Second, we find evidence of large positive between-village spillover effects on total income, food security, and business outcomes in control villages. Third, we estimate positive direct effects of the program on business outcomes and financial inclusion. Finally, we estimate that 23-28% of the overall benefits of the program are not captured by an analysis which does not account for spatial spillover effect
