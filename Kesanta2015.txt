This study explores the impact of economic empowerment among women and the well-being of their families and their communities through a community savings and loans association model. The research, conducted in Mgubwe, Tanzania, consists of 83 respondents from four villages, representing 12 Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs). Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using Focus Group Discussions (FGD), survey questionnaires and key in-depth interview methodologies. The findings indicated women who participate in community-based micro-lending associations have positive impacts on their childrenâ€™s education, health, and livelihoods. The findings also revealed members of community savings and loans groups do not collectively participate in community-based projects. The study provides evidence-based information that could motivate development practitioners in promoting and improving the community based savings group model as one of the key interventions for poverty eradication.
