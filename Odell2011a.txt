It is not unusual for well-established Savings Groups to provide a platform for social interventions. However, WORTH, a women’s empowerment programme implemented by Pact International in Nepal, is unusual inthat it combined Savings Groups’ activitieswith value-added, socially-focused activities from its inception. The value-added activities spearheaded byWORTH, including literacy training and business development services, function to support its primary objective: the empowerment of its members. Separate post-programme interventions utilised the skills Savings Group members had developed to conduct housing and health interventions.
