Created in 1995 in Senegal, the ‘Mutuelles de solidarité’ were introduced in South-Kivu, one of the provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, since 2002. Actually, more than 1,000 groups gather over 16,000 members in that area. With the goals of accumulating funds and self organization by using democratic rules, this structure helps people in rural areas on managing flow fluxes and risks, through the mutual aid fund and the saving and loan fund of sort. The structure was inspired on the tontine’s principle but this was implemented by the introduction of simple countable rules and techniques. This paper explores this new experiment, which articulates the microfinance, the micro-insurance and the structuring of the poor milieu. Even though, the financial and social performances of the “mutuelles de solidarité” in the South-Kivu seem a bit weak or not very significant because of quite of few reasons: small contributions, weak amounts of the credit and the social interventions granted in the event of disaster, negative correlation between the age and the recovering rates of contributions, etc), the originality and richness of this work lay on its contribution to strengthen the social cohesion and give a structure to that post conflict area. It could thus be used as a basis for the installation of large scale mechanisms of finance and insurance in the region. In spite of this point of optimism, many questions require further attention of researchers: understand the factors which influence the decision to enroll or not, to drop out of the group; the informal practices of microfinance and microinsurance used by people excluded from the financial classic system and the contribution of the ‘Mutuelles de solidarité’ to the improvement of the political organization and social capital of the members
