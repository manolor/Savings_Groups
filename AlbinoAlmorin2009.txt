The objective of this field research was to study in rural community saving groups the relationships between different ways of management, on the hand and organizational characteristics of the saving groups and the external supports given to these community groups by government and non government institutions, on the other hand. With the case research methodology and Endogenous Development theoretical framework, 56 saving community saving and loaning groups from the Central Valleys of the states of Puebla and Oaxaca, were investigated. It was found a great diversity of saving and loan management ways; all of these are different from the most important conventional microfinance orientations that exist nowadays; and it can not be to recommended or formulated a general saving and loaning community system.
The main conclusion was that the well functioning of the saving and loaning community groups depends on the specific physical, social, economic and political context that each one the groups faces. In spite of this, those community saving and loaning groups which function better are the ones which are more flexible and homogeneous during their maturation and consolidation process.
