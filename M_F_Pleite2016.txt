Poverty levels that lives a significant percentage of population in many developing countries, often accompanied by a lack of access to savings products, payment, credit or insurance, which determine high levels of financial exclusion. In this paper, we present the case of a savings bank project developed a decade ago by the Le√≥n XIII Foundation in Mexico. After analyzing this experience, we present the data obtained with a survey realized to 218 beneficiaries. The bivariate and multivariate analysis of this information, besides allowing quantifying the living conditions of the beneficiaries, provides valuable information about the saving capacity of the population reached through this initiative, segmenting its beneficiaries in consideration of their characteristics and their saving effort.
