The interest of actors in approaches to empowering the poor is increasingly evident in developing countries. In a context such as that of Burundi where there are more than six different approaches, it is necessary to enlighten practitioners in their choices as to the approach to be considered. This is a qualitative study focusing on a comparative analysis of two approaches: VSLA and SHG. Statistical processing and analysis of data collected from 35 practitioners was done using materials like Google Forms, Microsoft Excel, and IBM SPSS 25. Interviews with the heads of organizations that implement both approaches confirmed and reinforced the results obtained from these materials. Thus, the results show that the VSLA approach targets the economic empowerment of the poor in addition to other types of categories. The social aspect is considered through the social fund to assist members in case of happy or unfortunate events. This is also the case for SHGs. But the SHG approach particularly targets the poorest, and to some extent the poor. In addition to this, SHGs focus on the economic, social and leadership aspects of members. It is also interested in needs of community interest, beyond SHG groups. The results of this study pave the way for further research that should be conducted to shed more light on empowerment approaches, considered as an alternative in development practices.
