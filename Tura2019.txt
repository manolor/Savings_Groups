Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes. Although maternal health services, especially antenatal care (ANC), can act as a link to IPV resources, women experiencing IPV likely have reduced uptake of ANC due to social and emotional barriers. Poor ANC uptake can also further exacerbate adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there is limited research examining the association between IPV and ANC within the context of Mozambique. Using data from a study conducted to assess the impact of membership in savings groups on maternal health service utilization in Mozambique (N = 205), we investigated the association between IPV and uptake of ANC. Pearson chi-square and logistic regression were employed to examine the association between IPV and ANC service utilization. The mean age of the participants was 33.4 years (SD = 11.88). Overall, 47.3%, 83.4%, and 51.7% of the participants reported experiencing IPV, receiving at least one ANC, and four or more ANC, respectively. Women who reported experience of IPV had lower odds of receiving both at least one (AOR 0.31 [95% CI:0.12–0.82]) and four or more ANC (AOR 0.50 [95% CI: 0.27–0.92]). Women who reported experience of IPV also had lower odds of receiving ANC from skilled personnel (AOR 0.32 [95% CI: 0.10–0.90]). Experience of IPV showed significant association with reduced ANC service utilization among women in the study area. Further study is needed to assess whether the negative association between IPV and ANC service utilization is also a causal relationship, the evidence which will then help guide a comprehensive intervention effort to improve maternal health services use.
