A multi-year study of smallholder farmer groups in the Dominican Republic and Haiti provides multidimensional evidence of social-ecological resilience using four distinct data sources:A rapid assessment conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact metrics collected in 2017 and late 2020. Savings group behaviour metrics collected every 3 months. Participatory analysis conducted by farmers and community members. This mixed-methods analysis indicates that smallholder farmers participating in locally based autonomous savings groups are more likely to have COVID response plans in their community, and exhibit metrics of resilience such as increased amounts of savings reserves, income diversity, and regenerative farming practice diversity. Farmers in these groups showed little sign of changed engagement in group practices such as meeting attendance, savings investment or loan activity, and in some cases showed increased engagement. While this observational study does not allow a statistically verifiable causal link between group participation and resilience, participatory analysis by farmers themselves directly links group participation with increased ability to address the shock represented by the pandemic.
