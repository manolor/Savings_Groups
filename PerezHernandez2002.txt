Since community saving systems are a mean or strategy for small rural poor farmers to finance production activities and to solve some of their most important problems concerned with their well being, the objective of this investigation is to study the factors related with the success or failure of community saving systems, named “Cajas de ahorro”. This is a case study research concerned with the “Federación de Sociedades de Solidaridad Social” (FESSSCOT) in the “Cordillera del Tentzo” of the state of Puebla, Mexico. To accomplish the objective of this investigation, several aspects of the community saving groups were studied, such as planning, organization, integration, evaluation, as well as their antecedents, functioning and internal problems.
Because of this research approach, it was used the neoclassical administration theory in order to explain the problem and to design the field information collecting instruments. The using of this theoretical and practical tools allowed to build the case of the present status of the saving groups. The most important results found were that some components of the theory are not used by the saving groups because of their special characteristics and the social, cultural and geographic environment in which they carry out their activities
