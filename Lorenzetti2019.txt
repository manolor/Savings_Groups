Savings groups are an economic strengthening intervention used to enhance the well-being of vulnerable groups. However, it is unclear how savings groups influence treatment outcomes for people living with HIV. This article reports on a study that conducted 48 in-depth interviews with HIV-positive savings group members in Ethiopia and used their narratives to qualitatively assess pathways linking savings group participation to adherence, retention, and general well-being. No single pathway was described, but almost the entire sample described improved adherence or retention through a combination of increased food security, economic and social well-being. The complexity of pathways supports the necessity for multisectoral approaches that address structural barriers to care.
